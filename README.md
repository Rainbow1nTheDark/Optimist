# **Optimist: A Trust-Oriented Dapp Rating System on Optimism**

## **Introduction**

Optimist is a decentralized application (Dapp) built on the Optimism blockchain, designed to enhance transparency and trust within the Web3 ecosystem. It enables users to rate and review decentralized applications, fostering a community-driven reputation system that helps users make informed decisions about which Dapps to trust and use.

## **Why Optimist?**

The Web3 space is rapidly growing with numerous Dapps available to users. However, this vast array often leaves users overwhelmed and uncertain about the security, reliability, and **trustworthiness of these applications**. Optimist addresses this challenge by providing a platform where community feedback leads the way in determining the **trustworthiness of Dapps and their decisions**.

## **Features**

- **Home Page**: Displays a list of registered Dapps along with their community ratings. Users can search and filter through the list to find applications of interest.
- **Dapp Registration**: Allows users to register new Dapps on the platform, ensuring the database is continually updated with the latest applications.
- **Dapp Rating and Reviews**: Users can leave detailed reviews and rate Dapps, contributing to the overall trust score of each application.
- **My Reviews**: Users can view and manage their review history, with options to update or delete their past contributions.

## **Future Directions**

- **Governance Integration**: The next phase includes incorporating features to review and rate governance proposals directly on Optimism. This extension will empower users to actively participate in the governance processes of their favorite Dapps.
- **Cross-Blockchain Support**: Optimist is already equipped to support applications across various blockchains. While our initial focus has been on Optimism and Ethereum, our platform is designed to serve the broader Web3 community, enhancing the transparency and reliability of Dapps across different blockchain ecosystems.
